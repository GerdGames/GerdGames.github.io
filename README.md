# WORKSHOP AGENDA

## __Hour 1__
### Part 1a: Setting Up  
1. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. [Download Atom IDE](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/).
4. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/) and make sure you are logged in.
5. Now navigate to the [workshop's Git repository](https://github.com/zleckron/cseduclub) where the starter files exist.
6. _Fork_ the repository to your account by pressing the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner.
7. *__IMPORTANT:__* Rename the newly forked repository to `username.github.io`, where `username` is your username on GitHub. No exceptions. Follow steps 1 through 4 to do this: https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-a-repository
8. Copy to clipboard the url to your renamed Git repo i.e. `https://github.com/username/username.github.io`
9. Now from an easily accessible place on your computer (i.e. "My Documents"), create a new folder and name it "Websites" (you can name it whatever you want but we'll use "Websites" for consistency).
*__Protip:__ avoid having spaces in your folder names; instead use a dash or underscore.*
10. Open up a terminal. On MacOS, open the pre-installed app called Terminal. On Windows, open the pre-installed app Command Prompt.
11. In the terminal, execute each command below, line by line. Replace `username` with your GitHub username. Zoee will show you how to navigate to a folder using the cd command. The $ symbol indicates that these are command-line instructions; do not type it.
###
```sh
$ cd <path to folder containing Website folder>/Websites
$ git config --global user.email "Your Email associated w/ GitHub"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
$ cd username.github.io
<unzip the workshop-demo.zip file in your finder>
$ npm install
$ npm rebuild node-sass
$ npm start
```
###
12. Now from your Atom IDE, open `username.github.io` (File > Open > navigate to and select `username.github.io` folder).
13. [Add the atom-live-server package]by visiting this link (https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server) and clicking the green "Install" button.
14. In Atom IDE, enter `ctrl-alt-l` for PC/Windows users and `ctrl-option-l` for MacOS users.
15. Go to `localhost:3000` in a browser of your choice (if one doesn't open up for you) and marvel at what is being rendered from your starter code. __DON'T WORRY -__ you will get a chance to customize the site later on in the workshop. But first ...


### Part 1b: Brief Overview of HTML & SCSS
1. Open the HTML & CSS presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/124nU7ZKkGKpjYBQ6iwncdnb-aAI8JUVX2V-SuWC8cfA/edit?usp=sharing
2.  in the Atom IDE, open the HelloWorld.html file located in your repository and also in a browser of your choice. You can do this by double clicking the HelloWorld.html file in a file explorer program on your computer, or you can open a new tab in your browser and go to `File > Open...` and navigate and select HelloWorld.html.
3. To find out more about the page you are working on, try using the inspect feature in the browser! You can open the inspect panel in Chrome by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting `Inspect` from the menu that pops up. See if you can figure out what's wrong with the page from the `Console` pane.
4. Whenever you make changes to the html file, save it and look at what happened in the browser after refreshing the page (the refresh keyboard shortcut is `ctrl-R` on Windows, `cmd-R` on MacOS ). You can save with `ctrl-s` on Windows and `cmd-s` on Mac.
5. Experiment with changing the font, title, pictures, etc. on the html file.
6. When you are satisfied with the changes you have made to the HelloWorld.html file, you can close it.

## __Hour 2__
### Part 2: Customize with [Bulma](http://bulma.io)
1. Now return to your Atom IDE and follow along with Zoee in this interactive __*LIVE coding*__ session. The goal here is to get you familiar with Bulma's file structure as well as Bulma's syntax for using its various components.

Once you are more or less happy with how your site looks in `localhost:3000`, it is now time to "push" these new changes up to your newly created GitHub account.

2. Open up a __second__ terminal and run the following commands.
###
```sh
$ cd <path to folder containing Website folder>/Websites
$ git status
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push -u origin master
```
###
3. â€¦ and you're done! Fire up a browser and go to `https://username.github.io`.
4. Do a little dance to celebrate your very first website!


_Check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) if you want to change the default url to a custom domain, among other things._

_Finally, don't forget to check out all the other cool links we recommend for your benefit (i.e. [Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/) for a custom domain if you don't have one already). They can all be found in the workshop slides that will be emailed to you. **You're Welcome! :)**_
